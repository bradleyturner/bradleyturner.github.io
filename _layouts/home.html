    <span class="page-section-heading">I've been growing as a designer at Handshake for almost 4 years now</span>
    <p>
      I started designing while studying Software Engineering at Michigan
      Tech. Since starting as an intern at Handshake in 2016, I’ve worked on a variety of design projects
      and helped grow our design system and processes as our team grew from 35
      to over 200 employees.

      <li class="home-photo">
        <img class="rounded-corners" src="/assets/images/carousel/pride.jpg" />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I’ve led designer on a variety of projects, collaborating with
      PMs to dig into our challenges and articulate compelling problem
      statements, conducting user research and user testing, and partnering with
      engineers to deliver high quality, accessible experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I continue to get excited about digging into complex systems, sharing
      findings with the team and searching for opportunities to simplify them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of the design world I spend my free time running and baking whatever new pastry I most recently discovered.
