I joined Blackfynn in April 2020. For the past 4 years, I’d been designing products to help college students find jobs, building my design skills and contextual knowledge. I was excited about applying my those and experience to an entirely different industry: Parkinson’s Disease research.

I quickly realized just how much I had to learn about this new industry.

> “Your first project is going to be updating our LEDD ConMed Log so that researchers can collect a standard calculated daily dose of levodopa equivalent medication for each patient by providing a curated list of medications like carbidopa/levodopa, amantadine, benzotropine, etc.” 

That project description captures a lot of my year at Blackfynn. I found myself jumping into conversations and projects where the basic vocabulary was completely foreign to me, absorbing as much context as possible, and then applying everything I knew about design to deliver high quality products for our partners and users.

Reflecting back on my year at Blackfynn, the three projects below represent some of my favorite examples of blending past experience with a new industry to produce high quality results.

## Checking assumptions about how people with Parkinson’s Disease experience technology

One of my favorite projects I worked on was designing a platform to engage up to 500,000 people in a digital Parkinson’s study. During this project I ran user testing sessions to supplement our assumptions with real feedback and observations from people with Parkinson’s using our product.

### We validated our approach and resolved conflicting internal opinions with user testing
In early conversations about this product, we had many assumptions (sometimes conflicting) about how people with PD interact with technology and how those assumptions should influence the design of this product. I wanted to make sure we had real evidence to inform our decisions going forward.

After exploring many options and iterating on rounds of internal feedback, I built 2 prototypes of a digital health platform and observed 6 people with Parkinson’s use these prototypes.

Through these tests, we gained valuable insights:
* **There wasn’t one way that a participant’s tremor impacted their experience with technology.** Experiences depended on what type of device the participant was using, whether they were holding that device, and when they’d last taken medication.
* **Larger fonts and tap targets helped all participants use the product.** Many participants specifically mentioned how much easier it was to use compared to other apps and websites they use today.
* **Following a linear navigation pattern created frustration for many participants.** Many participants wanted to revisit a previous part of the product which was hard to do in one version of the prototype.

### These insights built confidence in our design decisions

Conducting these user tests helped us spot usability issues early on, built confidence in our design decisions internally and externally, and gave us valuable insights that we could re-apply in future patient-facing products and features.

While the patterns and styles I used in this product were quite different from those I’d used in past products targeted at college students, the process of user testing and gathering early insights was largely the same. We created space to be wrong, test assumptions, and learn along the way, resulting in a better product for our users and partners.

## Improving design quality and engineering handoff with a Figma component library

In addition to tackling core product projects, I worked on a variety of design process and tooling improvements. Establishing and maintaining our component library in Figma has been a highlight of my experience at Blackfynn.

### I heard similar complaints about design and engineering collaboration at Blackfynn and Handshake. Figma was the solution.

When I joined Blackfynn we were using a combination of Adobe Xd and Abstract to manage design files, share design with engineers, and present prototypes to our partners. During my first month I often heard feedback from various stakeholders about things that I’d seen solved by Figma in the past, so I worked with our team to transition to Figma without slowing down our cadence of work.

In order to improve our design quality and consistency, I audited and documented our styles, components, and patterns. I partnered with engineers and designers to understand how these were currently used and where we had opportunities for cleaning up.

### This library has already helped us create consistent, high quality designs, sped up our ability to produce mock ups, and improved engineering collaboration.

By documenting all of these components and patterns we had a clear source of truth. We no longer had designs or implemented components that had slight variance in styles. This source of truth also made it easy for us to then make improvements over the course of the year.

When implementing this component library I wanted to make sure we didn’t limit ourselves to the status quo of components and styles. When I helped build our first component system at Handshake, we didn’t create this space for exploring outside of the system which resulted in unnecessary UX sacrifices.

At Blackfynn, we’ve set different expectations: encouraging exploration, starting with sketching, and asking ourselves whether the problem could be solved better by breaking out of our established system.

## Growing my skillset while evolving our illustration style

Even though I brought my own skills and experience to Blackfynn, I still had opportunities to step outside of my comfort zone. My favorite one of these opportunities was evolving our illustration style.

### We needed to account for additional use cases outside of spot illustrations while maintaining our brand voice

I had very little experience with illustration at this point. This was a great opportunity for to learn from peers, invest in my skills, and grow as a designer while producing great work for the team. At the same time, I brought my own design approach and systems mindset and applied to reach a different type of output and result.

I worked with the design team to create moodboards for our styles, set some initial guidelines, and then started exploring. I used Procreate and Illustrator to explore a few directions, and refined my approach after gathering feedback from the team.

### We now have an illustration system that provides more depth while still maintaining our brand values.

As part of this project, I documented my approach and created templates for the team to use in future illustrations. In a sense I re-applied some of my design system principles to illustration to make it easy for any member of the design team to create their own assets and expand the system

## I’m grateful for the opportunity to share my experience, grow as a designer, and contribute to the Parkinson’s research community

The past year has been personally rewarding. I got to work with an amazing team, bring my experience to the table, and learned a lot along the way.
